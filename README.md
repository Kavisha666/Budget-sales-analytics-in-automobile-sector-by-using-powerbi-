## Data Analysis Project: Budget Sales Analysis

### Overview:
This repository documents my latest Data Analysis project completed.  The project focuses on analyzing sales data within the bike and automobiles sector, specifically delving into retail and sales metrics.

### Problem Statement:
The project aims to streamline the "Domain Sale" process, enabling potential buyers to purchase desired domains without directly contacting sellers. Sellers list domains at set prices in our Marketplace, and interested buyers can seamlessly purchase them.

### Key Features:

- Comparative analysis across various attributes such as products and customers.
- Exploration of trends and financial metrics spanning the years 2014 to 2016.

- CLR (Customer Increment Ratio)
- ARPU (Average Revenue per User)
- CLP (Customer Lifecycle Pan)
- Gross profit
- Net profit
- Profit margin %
- COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)
